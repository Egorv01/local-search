## Overview

Local Search is a powerful tool designed to enhance your experience with the Apple WWDC 2025 documentation. This project utilizes the local embedding model `.bge_small` to create an on-device local semantic search index. By leveraging the latest information from the WWDC 2025 documentation, the app allows you to perform natural language searches and find relevant documentation snippets quickly and efficiently.

The app crawls the official Apple documentation, generates vector embeddings for the content, and enables similarity ranking for search results. This means you can find exactly what you need without sifting through endless pages of documentation.

## Features

- **Semantic Search**: Input your query and retrieve the most relevant documentation snippets based on vector similarity.
- **Automatic Crawling**: The app automatically fetches and indexes content from the official [WWDC 2025 documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/updates/wwdc2025/).
- **Modern SwiftUI Interface**: Enjoy a clean and responsive user interface with a search bar and result list that makes navigation easy.
- **Source Linking**: Each search result links directly to the original Apple documentation page, allowing you to explore further.
- **Local Embedding Generation**: The app utilizes MLX and MLXEmbedders for on-device embedding, ensuring that your searches are both fast and efficient.
